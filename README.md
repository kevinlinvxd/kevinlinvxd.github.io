## Welcome to my Portfolio!

This is my personal website that I've started up just as a way for me to re-familiarize myself with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This website was built with Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub Pages. Although bare right now, eventually I will be adding in my personal projects, a blog section, etc.

You can access the website a variety of ways, but the easiest would be just clicking the link in the repository description.
Or, click [here](https://kevinlinvxd.me).
